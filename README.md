# 🤖 Arabic Gemini Chat Widget

Welcome to the **Arabic-Gemini-Widget** repository!

This project is a fully interactive and self-contained **chat widget** built with a simple, vanilla frontend (HTML, CSS, JS). It connects directly to the **Gemini API** and is specifically designed to support the Arabic language (RTL) with built-in internet search capabilities.

---

## ✨ Core Features

* **Full RTL Support:** CSS styling is configured to fully support Right-to-Left (RTL) text direction, ideal for Arabic and other RTL languages.
* **Direct AI Connection:** Uses the **Gemini API** (`gemini-2.5-flash` model) for generating responses.
* **Internet Grounding:** The Google Search tool (`Google Search`) is enabled to provide the model with up-to-date and contextual information. 
* **Robust Error Handling:** Implements an **Exponential Backoff** mechanism to gracefully handle rate limit (429) and network errors during API calls.
* **Vanilla Frontend:** Built exclusively using **HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript**, requiring no external frontend frameworks.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

To get the chat widget working locally, you must obtain and configure your Gemini API key.

### 1. Clone the Repository


###2. Get Your Gemini API Key
Visit the official Google AI Studio website to generate and copy your API key.

###3. Configure the Key in script.js
Open the script.js file and replace the placeholder value in the apiKey variable with your actual key:
JavaScript

// script.js
const apiKey = "AIzaSy...YOUR_FULL_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"; 
###4. Run the Widget
Simply open the chat.html file directly in your web browser.

🔒 Security Notice (Critical)
This project, in its current form, exposes your API key directly in the client-side JavaScript code.

⚠️ This approach is highly insecure and is strictly for local development and testing purposes only.

DO NOT deploy this code to a public production environment without taking the following security measures:

Use a Backend Proxy: Implement a server-side proxy (e.g., using Node.js, Python Flask) to store the API key securely as an environment variable and handle all calls to the Gemini API.

Restrict the Key: Limit the API key's capabilities in the Google Cloud settings to accept requests only from specific IP addresses or domains.
